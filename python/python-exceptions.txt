Python exceptions:

User code can raise built-in exceptions. This can be used to test an exception handler or to report an error condition Ågjust likeÅh the situation in which the interpreter raises the same exception; but beware that there is nothing to prevent user code from raising an inappropriate error

The built-in exception classes can be sub-classed to define new exceptions; programmers are encouraged to at least derive new exceptions from the Exception class and not BaseException. More information on defining exceptions is available in the Python Tutorial under User-defined Exceptions

The class hierarchy for built-in exceptions is:

 +-- KeyboardInterrupt
 +-- GeneratorExit
